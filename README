quotationtool.biblatex
**********************

The ``quotationtool.biblatex'' package provides a database for storing
a BibLaTeX bibliography. It is based on the Blue Bream (aka Zope3)
application server and can be used as both: a standalone http server
that keeps your biliographic information, or a set of libraries that
can be used to write your own biblatex app (be it for the web or be it
for your desktop).

Read INSTALL for installing an running the http server.
